# TimeSeriesForecasting
Time Series Forecasting using XGBoost Classifier
Qn1: Briefly describe the conceptual approach you chose! What are the trade-offs?
#Conceptual Approach:
    1. Read The data through python Pandas.
    2. Cleaning the Data.
    3.Analysing the Data by plotting a graph.
    4.Changing the Timestamp column of the dataframe to year, month, day, minutes, hour, second separate columns.
    5.Fitting the model in a XGBoost Classifier for prediction.
    6.Predicting the output of the test data.
    7.Plotting the time series test data.
#Trade Off:
Qn2: What's the model performance?
The accuracy on the test split of the training dataset is 99.15%.

QN3: What's the runtime performance? What is the complexity? Where are the bottlenecks?
Qn4: If you had more time, what improvements would you make, and in what order of priority?
